```{r setup, include=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library("od")
library("sf")
library("tmap")
library("dplyr")
library("readr")
library("here")


```

In this script I lean heavily on the od package vignette to 


```{r read in the data}
# read in the data and clean the column names to make processing easier
blue_bike_data  <- read_csv(here("data","202212-bluebikes-tripdata.csv")) |> janitor::clean_names()

# get blue bike station locations
station_data <- read_csv(here("data", "current_bluebikes_stations.csv"), skip = 1)|> janitor::clean_names()
```
I need to transform the data into origin-destination format. So that there is an is an origin column, destination column, and trip count column - in addition to the accessory data. 


```{r create a location table}

##### THIS IS PROBABLY USELESS #########
# first select necessary start columns
station_locations <- blue_bike_data |> select(start_station_id, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude) |> distinct()

# remove start from column names
colnames(station_locations) <- gsub(pattern = "start_", replacement = "", x= colnames(station_locations))

# turn into point locations. I'm assuming the lat long crs is mercator
station_locations <- st_as_sf(station_locations, coords = c("station_longitude","station_latitude"),crs=4326)
```


Here's a qucik plot of all the blue bike station locations in boston as of 2022
```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(station_locations)+
  tm_dots()
```


```{r create a station name table}
blue_bike_data |> 
  select(start_station_id, start_station_id)
```



```{r}

```


```{r}
blue_bike_data |> 
  group_by(start_station_id, end_station_id) |>
  mutate(count = n()) |> 
  select(start_station_id, end_station_id, count, everything()) |> 
  arrange(desc(count))
```
