```{r setup, include=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library("od")
library("sf")
library("tmap")
library("dplyr")
library("readr")
library("here")
library("dodgr")

```

In this script I lean heavily on the od package vignette to 


```{r read in the data}
# read in the data and clean the column names to make processing easier
blue_bike_data  <- read_csv(here("data","202212-bluebikes-tripdata.csv")) |> janitor::clean_names()

# get blue bike station locations
station_data <- read_csv(here("data", "current_bluebikes_stations.csv"), skip = 1)|> janitor::clean_names()
```
I need to transform the data into origin-destination format. So that there is an is an origin column, destination column, and trip count column - in addition to the accessory data. 

```{r r}
start_end_count <- blue_bike_data |> 
  select(start_station_id,start_station_name, end_station_id, end_station_name) |> 
  group_by(start_station_name, end_station_name) |>
  summarize(count = n()) |> 
  select(start_station_name, end_station_name, count, everything()) |> 
  arrange(desc(count))
```


```{r make station data spatial }
station_locations <- st_as_sf(station_data, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs=4326) |> select(name, everything())
```

```{r}
desire_lines = od_to_sf(start_end_count, station_locations)
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(desire_line)+
  tm_lines(lwd = "count", col = "count", palette = "blue")
```

```{r}
desire_lines = od_to_network(start_end_count, station_locations)
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(desire_line)+
  tm_lines(lwd = "count", col = "count", palette = "blue")
```


Here's a qucik plot of all the blue bike station locations in boston as of 2022
```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(station_locations)+
  tm_dots()
```


```{r create a station name table}
blue_bike_data |> 
  select(start_station_id, start_station_id)
```



```{r}

```


```{r}

```
